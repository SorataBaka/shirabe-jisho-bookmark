# Shirabe Jisho Bookmark Creator

## Description

This project was created for the usage with the IOS Dictionary App, Shirabe Jisho.
I have found that creating a bookmark for a word in the app a tedious task, and I wanted to create a simple app that can make the process much more efficient.

## Credits

I found the source to the dictionary via JMDict on the following link:
